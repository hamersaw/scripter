# scripter
## OVERVIEW
Generalized framework for managing script execution.

## TODO
- fix background execution - it is not very clean
    - can we use code from nethammer/wifi/rouge-ap.sh?
- json printing pretty - do we want to move away from json? to yaml?
- process: print off logs
- write python library
